\section{Introduction}
Malidraxies is a world shrouded in chaos. The post-apocalyptic setting is a result of the war between the gods Vaxel god of magic and Vexil god of the divine. The aftermath of the war resulted in a magical fallout, and darkness has overtaken the world. The corruption slowly seeps across the planes and through the earth, only a few places are left unaffected by the disastrous transition. The affiliated gods have been injured, and some left forgotten, and the world known to them has ended.\\ Subsequently the passage of time has left history soon to be buried, leaving only a glimpse of the past. With the world in ruins, civilisation has tried to adjust, but with the new world came the changes. Droughts, plagues and other disasters, were the least worrying, what came after was the most unnerving. In the beginning people thought nothing of it, but then it took a turn. It began as physical changes, one day you would wake up missing some teeth, or even discovering that your skin has lost all colour, but when the madness spread, people were left horrified.\\
Society is now left intimidated and horrified by the prospect of adventuring and exploring. Only a few people are brave, or stupid enough to leave their homes willingly. But civilisation is in need of these morons. Not the treasures, stories, and achievements they leave home searching for, but the hope. Created by their sometimes shortsighted and rash actions. Actions that could lead to a shift in this disaster that has left mankind baffled.
