\section{1: Introduction}
Malidraxies is a continent torn by chaos. The post-apocalyptic setting is a result of the war between the gods Vaxel god of death, and Vexil god of life. The aftermath of the war resulted in a magical fallout, and darkness has overtaken the world. The corruption slowly seeps across the planes and through the earth, only a few places are left unaffected by the disastrous transition. Most affiliated gods have been injured, some even left forgotten, and the world known to them has ended.\\ Subsequently the passage of time has left history soon to be buried, leaving only a glimpse of the past. With the world in ruins, civilisation has tried to adjust, but with the new world came the changes. Droughts, plagues and other disasters, were the least of people's worries, what came after was the most unnerving. In the beginning people thought nothing of it, but then it took a turn. It began as physical changes, one day you would wake up missing some teeth, or even discovering that your skin has lost all colour, but when madness spread, people were left horrified.\\
The surrounding continents of Phaalner, Grend, and Seramur have been trying to restrain the effects. Tirelessly searching for the cause of this catastrophe, while dooming the citizens of the once prospering continent to fend for themselves.\\
Society is now left intimidated and horrified by the prospect of adventuring and exploring. Only a few people are brave, or stupid enough to leave home following their intrepid dreams. But civilisation is in need of these morons. Not the treasures, stories, and achievements they leave home searching for, but the hope. Created by their sometimes shortsighted and rash decisions. Actions that could lead to a shift in this disaster that has left mankind baffled.

\section{2: History}
Nixera possesses a history brimming with strife, and has witnessed the fall of many eras.
\subsection{Prehistory}
In the beginning all was void. But from rips in the fabric of nothingness radiance surfaced. The friction between these two powers created lacerations in space, and from these gashes the outer planes were created. These spiritual planes were the birthplaces of the first gods. It was here the first concepts of good, evil, chaotic and lawful were conceptualized.\\
These outer planes were chaotically swaying in the churning void, falling in and out of each others parallels, but as the inner planes conceptualized they worked as an anchor. Surrounded by the elemental chaos the material planes were created.\\
The gods sought power from this realm, and sometimes these interactions had unseen consequences. Other planes were created, some corresponding to the gods nature. The transitive and parallel planes such as the Ethereal plane, the Feywild, and the Shadowfell.\\
In an effort to stop the divide, the gods agreed to use mortals to settle their disputes. The mortals who sought strength from the gods, became their messengers, and some were even awarded immortality or near godhood. Mortals who aided their deities could anticipate rewards such as "second lives". Mankind has since then been taken to the brink of destruction, and then reestablished many times. Many a time a god has strayed from their promise, interfering with the mortal plane, only time can tell what effect such occurrences will develop into.

\subsubsection{Before the war}
\textbf{More information will be open for you as you ask and learn about the properties of Nixera}
\\
Many thought the era before the war was one of peace and prosperity. On the surface this seemed to be true, but those that new better called it \textit{a cold war}. This was not long after Tiamat had been banished to the astral plane.
\subsection{The war}
Not much is known about the war. Only the effects of the drawn-out battle are clear.  
\subsubsection{Instigation}
Most say the war was grounded in the deep sibling rivalry between Vaxel and Vexil. Others think the war was instigated because of some sort of artefact, that lured the gods into action 
\section{3: The world}
Nixera is a large world with 5 continents
\subsection{Phaalner}
Is called the endless continent. Noone knows how much is left unexplored and many believe this land is endless.

\subsubsection{Halfling society}
Halflings are usually simple creatures, they fit into every civilization, and usually live simple lives. They are usually a happy people, some wander, others stay in their burrow cities for their whole lives. 

\subsubsection{Ã†milie's burrow city}

\subsubsection{Hazeltown}
A large independent city, with a large cultural history. The biggest attraction of this city is their winters crest festival, a festival that commemorates the new year, the middle of winter, and the solstice. It is viewed as a turn for the better, and a brief cross of the planes.

\subsection{Grend}
is the largest and most eastern continent. Most of the continent is controlled by different human kingdoms with varying degrees of independence and isolation.

\subsubsection{Draconia}
Draconia is the kingdom of the dragonborn. Their society is extremely isolated from other societies, and therefore also very unique. Most dragonborns seek power, and their hierarchy is build for the acquisition of power. There are very strict rules forbidding especially killing dragonborn with the exception of revanants because they are lower beings.
\\
\textbf{Clan structure}
Some dragonborn thought collaboration would give them a chance to acquire the power they seek, so some banded together which at some point created the clans.
\\
There are seven major clans consisting of Tyraqis (mostly red) Darghus (mostly white) Varhdrhe (only green and black) Shrrewh (mostly blue) Gruuh (black, white, and red) Drackt (mostly green and blue), and Phreesh (mostly black)
\\
\textbf{Tyraqis}
The Tyraqis clan consists of red dragonborn, with slight color variations like orange dark, light or  near yellow scales. Their clan is very arrogant, and believes itself to be the strongest clan. The internal hierarchy is dependent on strength, they have a board of the five strongest members of their clan, and a chief which makes decisions for the clan. The boards decisions are law, and if you don't follow the orders of those stronger than you, battle can decide the dispute.
\\
\textbf{Power struggle}
The power struggle mostly happens behind the scene. There are countless rivalries between dragonborn, and a part of them thinks it is fun to play this type of political game. 
\\
\textbf{The military}
The hierarchy in the military is much like their clans dependent on strength, both physical and influential. The main army of draconia is very large, but they also have a division of wyvern-riders called the sunwing, who are proven warriors that combat most of the dangers found in their mountain range.

\subsubsection{Temple of the immortal}
The Immortal cultivators were a people that tried to transcend the physical body, reaching for superhuman abilities. Most of the people in the temple consisted of trainees, or teachers too old to travel or break through the threshold.
\\
The highest position in the order was that of the sky-hierarch, the leader of their people.
\\
\textbf{Transcending the mortal body}
Transcendence could either be achieved by travel, or cultivation in the transcendence-hall. This construct was made not too long ago, but was a rift in space which channelled a miasma, the teachers called the godmist.
\\ Training in the hall was dangerous, therefore it demanded constant vigilance over soul and body.
\\ It was not everyone that was gifted to the extend of reaching immortality, first one had to build up their body so that they could resist the effects of the godmist while gaining the benefits.
\\
\textbf{Destruction}
After an incident that happened just around the time that a new batch of disciples would be introduced into the path to immortal cultivation, all the disciples of this sect disappeared. Something managed to break the rift and leave a trail of destruction.

\subsubsection{Deep gnome society}
In dark caverns deep under the earth a society of deep gnomes prosper in Grent. Since the illithid civilisation was ruined, and their terror-regime ended, a large population of deep gnomes have banded together and formed the city Darkcave. The name Darkcave was decided by the founders of their civilisation who thought this name was extremely descriptive and therefore would keep any misunderstandings from happening when they chose to try connecting to the outside world.
\\
\textbf{Dark library}
The Dark library is the deep gnomes only way of attaining knowledge of the outside world, and you could say becoming a librarian there is the most prestigious post a gnome could have in their society. Knowledge demands respect and this is especially true when the recipiants of that knowledge know nothing. As a librarian you are chosen from young because of your aptitude for learning. All Dark librarians are wizards, and their quest is to acquire as much information about the outside world, help in diplomatic missions, give Darkcave a higher diplomatic status. Every fifty years a bunch of gnomes are send to the outside world to increase their skills and thereby setting their status in Darkcave.
\\
\textbf{High Dark Librarian} 
The High dark librarian is the most important position in the library, without him the Darkcave civilisation would perish. The only way to become a High Dark Librarian is by travelling to the five continents and gaining access to the five great libraries. This journey requires wit, power, and most importantly leadership. This is often done by becoming a leader of a group, thereby learning the skills necessary to lead the people and proving their aptitude for magic and knowledge. A new high librarian hasn't been chosen for the last 300 years, and without the knowledge gained from all five libraries the Darkcave people are frightened by the possibility that their ties with the outside world will be broken.

\subsection{Seramur}
In elfish Seramur means land of the west, or land of desert-winds. Large parts of this continent are arid.

\subsubsection{Goliath society}
In the mountainous region in southern Seramur two tribes of goliaths roam they have minor grievances, and most disputes stem from their competitive spirit. One tribe consisting of 37 goliaths is lead by the Stormborn, the other 57 goliaths strong is lead by Durock Brassjaw.
\\
\textbf{Appeasing the mountain}
Most goliaths fear the mountain of Onyxis, not for fear of burning or dying, but for fear of other's misfortune. Centuries ago the goliaths angered the mountain, after many days of black sky a thunderous voice rang, and demanded the tribes gave it gifts of gold and meat, stating otherwise it would burn the world. The skywatchers of both tribes decided to give this task to one goliath that would collect the gifts of both tribes and present them to the mountain. This position was called Firekeeper, and every 3 years the Firekeeper would have to travel up the mountain to deliver the treasure while also communicating with the fire. Even though the job of a Firekeeper was important. It also demanded near constant vigilance over the flame-mountain, which resulted in most Firekeepers becoming distant from their tribes. 


\subsubsection{Ralehh}
Elven city with harbor in the bottom part of seramur. There is a large part of the society that is poor, and have need for food, because the arid climate makes harvests poor. They get by, by using magically grown fruits and vegetables.

\subsection{Seramir}
In elfish Seramir means land of the east, or land of frozen heart. As supposed to the real world, because of Nixera's two suns there is only one cold pole on this plane.
